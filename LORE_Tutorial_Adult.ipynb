    "# Tutorial: explain a tabular classifier through LORE\n",
    "\n",
    "LORE provides interpretable explanations for the decisions made by machine learning models, particularly in situations where it might be challenging to explain the model's behavior using traditional methods. LORE is designed to offer explanations on a per-instance basis, meaning it provides insights into why a specific prediction was made for a particular data point. This is in contrast to global explanations that aim to provide an overview of a model's behavior across the entire dataset.\n",

    "In this tutorial we will explain the reasoning of a random forest classifier when applied to an instance of the Adult Income dataset ( https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/2/adult). This dataset contains census data from 1994 census database, the classification problem associated to such data involves the prediction of the annual income of a person, given a set of socio-economic caracteristics: \n",

    "Lore libray has a module devoted to dataset handling. Here we use TabularDataset class to load a dataset from a csv file. A TabularDataset has a column that represent the target class (`class_name`) of the classification task  object, and has two main attributes: \n",
    "- `df` : a pandas dataframe representing the tabular data\n",
    "- `descriptor` : a dictionary containing internal data related to the dataset. It is build when a TabularDataset is created, but it could also be edited. It is used by the next steps of LORE methodology to distinguish among numerical, categorical, ordinal and target features of the dataset."

We will use the `class_name` attribute of the dataset to identify the target feature of the classification task. Since the data contains non-numeric attributes, we proceed with a preprocessing of the data to mange these attributes. We will exploit `Pipeline` class from `sklearn` to create a pipeline that applies one-hot encoding to the categorical features and label encoding to the target feature. "
